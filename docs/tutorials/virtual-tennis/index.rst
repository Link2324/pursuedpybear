In this tutorial, we're going to build a game like Pong ---link---.

Before we start, let's think through what components make up a game like pong:

1. A ball that bounces on the walls
2. player paddles that can deflect the ball
3. A scoreboard that tracks how many times the ball leaves play.
4. A way to play more than one game.

This sounds like a small bit, but we're going to break these down into even
smaller steps and test as we go.

1. A window
1. A ball that bounces on the edges of the screen.
2. A player paddle that can be moved.
3. Collision between player paddle and ball.
4. A score board tracking how many times the player hits the far side of the
   screen.
5. Removing the ball from play when it hits the far wall.
6. Launching the ball with a key press.
7. Removing the ball if it hits the player's wall.
8. Adding a second player paddle.
9. Adding a new score board for second player.
10. End the game.
11. Ideas for making the game your own.
